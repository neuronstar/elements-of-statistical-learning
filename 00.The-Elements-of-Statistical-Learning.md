## What books are we reading?

1. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.


## When and How

The discussion is online through Skype/Wechat. It is usually held during the weekend.

This is the so called Russian style seminar.

1. Everyone will get their chance to lead the discussion.
2. Interrupt and ask for any questions.
3. Do not be carried away by the time schedule. The next host will pick up whatever has not yet been finished.

At this point, we have five different time zones.
